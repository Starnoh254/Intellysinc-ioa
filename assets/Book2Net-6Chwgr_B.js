Whether heavy newspaper volumes or large-format lightweights such as posters, plans and paintings – you need a scanning system for all of these with a focus on ergonomics. Just like the outstanding quality of the digitized documents and the high level of efficiency, this is a decisive factor why you should opt for our high-performance book2net Hornet scanner. It is the "big brother" of our book2net Mosquito scanner and scans documents in formats up to A0.

A central element is the motorized book cradle with two lifting columns. Each of them can be loaded with up to 180 kilos. This means that there are no limits to the selection of documents and books that can be scanned. The book2net Hornet is also available with a fixed support table as an option, but let's start with the book cradle here.

The A0 surface is divided into two halves. If you want to digitize a newspaper volume, for example, you can use the lifting columns so that the surface of the double pages is always at the same height. If you are scanning pages 5 and 6 of a thick volume, the right-hand column must move downwards, whereas once you have reached the last pages, the left-hand column moves downwards.

You can also save corresponding processes – for example, lowering a lifting column after a set number of pages – in the software. If you switch the scanner off and on again sometime later, all settings for this scan project are saved and you can continue working immediately without any delay.

The height of the book cradle can be adjusted by up to 25 centimeters, the same amount as the spine release. This makes the book2net Hornet ideal for gentle scanning of particularly thick books with sensitive spines.

In addition to the book cradle, this device is also equipped with a motorized glass plate. With gentle pressure, it ensures that there is no unevenness in the original. The motorized downward movement of the non-reflective glass plate should please every user, especially with large formats. As with all our systems, ergonomics is a top priority here too.

The technical features of the book2net Hornet are perfectly coordinated in every respect. Take the dual camera technology, for example, where you can choose between the M70 and M150 variants. The Schneider-Kreuznach precision lenses and CMOS area sensors guarantee that all areas of the original are captured simultaneously, which saves a considerable amount of time without compromising on quality. Further quality guarantees: the dual lighting unit, which can be controlled individually or synchronously, and the Fresnel lenses for uniform illumination.

Whether in Dubai, Mauritius or Brandenburg – the book2net Hornet has been used near and far and has done its job reliably. It is an absolute asset for every archive and library because it covers even the largest formats, delivers perfect quality and enables everyone who uses this system to work quickly and conveniently.`,categories:["A0","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS","ARCHIVE SCANNERS","BOOK SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Format",value:"A0"}]},{name:"Synchron Table LV2",slug:"repro-x-a02",image:"/images/book2net/A02.jpg",type:"A0+ art digitization scanner",overview:`The new era of art digitization

Diving into the structures

We are convinced that this scanner complements our book2net range perfectly. We have therefore decided to include the Synchron Table LV2 from CRUSE Technologies GmbH in our portfolio in addition to our high-quality scanning systems. Its technology is used less for digitizing historical written documents, sketches, posters or maps and more for materials such as wood or stone, as well as carpets and wallpaper, for example. And in formats from DIN A1 to DIN A0+.

What is it all about? The Synchron Table LV2 knows how to use its camera and lighting units so skillfully and flexibly that it captures and brings out every accentuation of the material down to the smallest detail. Among other things, the angle between the LED light and the original plays a decisive role. This scanner can also be set to different modes, depending on what you want to take a closer look at and present to all those who will be viewing the digital copy. For example, the heights and depths in the surface structure can be examined in detail.

The Synchron Table LV2 is used in art reproduction, for decorative surfaces and when it comes to investigating the interaction of light and material properties (PBR-based 3D rendering). Excellent resolution with 600 ppi, perfect illumination, not least thanks to the 150 sensors that monitor the LED temperature, and a color fidelity that leaves nothing to be desired − all this is given with the Synchron Table LV2.

The fact that the scanning table, which is available in different sizes, can withstand originals weighing up to 400 kilos, speaks for the robustness of this scanner on the one hand and underlines the variety of possible applications on the other. The originals, for example works of art, wood or stone, can be up to ten centimeters thick.

The Synchron Table LV2 leaves nothing to be desired and therefore fits perfectly into the range of our book2net scanning systems. Because excellent results are our top priority.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Mosquito",slug:"mosquito",image:"/images/book2net/Mosquito.jpg",type:"A1 high-end semi-robotic scanner",overview:`When compromise is not an option

The book2net Lizard can easily cope with large formats. This scanning system combines the highest quality of imaging with enormous productivity. What's more, the Lizard is designed to prevent damage to the large and often sensitive and valuable books that it transforms into the digital world.

Especially for old, bulky books with a binding and page curvature that require a reduced opening angle, the user has a variable V-shaped book support at their disposal, the plates of which can be adjusted between 80 and 120 degrees if required. To ensure that nothing goes wrong in the critical area of the book fold, the scanner also provides a spine exemption with a width of up to ten centimeters, optionally up to 20 centimeters, and a depth of up to eight centimeters. There is also a height-adjustable spine support to ensure that the book does not slip downwards.

To match the V-book cradle, the Lizard is equipped with a V-shaped 110° glass plate that can be controlled manually to gently smooth the book pages and thus achieve the best scanning results. It goes without saying that the plate is made of special non-reflective glass, so there are no negative effects on the scans.

This also applies to the uniform illumination of the book pages and the equally high scanning quality at every point on the surface, ensured by the CMOS area sensor technology, the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens and the double illumination unit consisting of cold light LEDs. You can choose between the M70 and the M150, both from MICROBOX, as the camera for the Lizard. Particularly with large-format originals, such as old atlases, the distance between the book fold and the lens is significantly greater than from the page edges to the lens. However, the unique double camera technology guarantees that the entire surface of the original is precisely captured and reproduced in perfect sharpness. The lighting is also of particular importance in this context, as the software is already set at the factory so that the most intense light shines in the direction of the book fold in order to precisely compensate for the long distance.

Brilliant color accuracy, perfect linearity, no distortions – the book2net Lizard achieves the highest quality. At the same time, the books to be digitized are optimally protected without compromising productivity. The scanning time of just 0.3 seconds and the processing time, i.e. from scanning to saving, of 3.5 seconds are more than impressive.

These are ideal conditions for tackling large and important projects. For example, when working with the National Library of Poland, where 652,000 very different objects are being digitized with the Lizard, including 305 particularly valuable atlases, the oldest of which dates back to 1522. A high level of responsibility towards all these works is required here, as well as outstanding efficiency to cope with this enormous volume.

A must in every digitization center

It's not easy to work carefully and gently while making rapid progress. Or is it? The hybrid scanning solution from book2net makes exactly that possible. In archives and libraries, you have to deal with very diverse collections: centuries-old, fragile and porous documents and books on the one hand, and masses of documents in stacks and boxes that seem almost impossible to process on the other. Digitizing all this is a challenge that requires a system you can rely on. Or even better: two systems.

The hybrid scanning solution from book2net combines the advantages of two "scanning worlds": contactless, gentle digitization by our overhead scanners in formats up to A1 with the efficiency of the SCAMIG document scanner specially designed for us, which can handle documents up to A3 in size.

The overhead scanner takes care of the gentle digitization of books, fragile documents or objects such as seals. It is easy to operate and guarantees excellent image quality. As a congenial partner, the SCAMIG is entrusted with robust individual pages or entire stacks of documents, which are fed and digitized much faster than could be achieved with an overhead scanner. But speed is not everything, because the SCAMIG also handles the sheets with care, as the patented belt transport is particularly gentle. The speed of the document feeder can also be reduced. And you can use the rear output tray for thicker paper or cardboard, for example, so that the document is not turned over in the device.

But how exactly does the application of the systems work in practice in the digitization process? Both devices are connected to the same computer. We are happy to provide a specially designed PC for this purpose. The advantage: all devices come from a single source and there is only one contact person. If you prefer to use your own computer, that is also possible. The software is then installed there.

The scans from the SCAMIG document scanner are also saved via the software of the overhead scanner and are available there for further processing and organization. Regardless of which scanner is currently in use, the documents are saved in the correct order. Thanks to the multi-page option, it is possible to save several documents in one file. The job function is also particularly convenient, as it can be used to save settings made for a project so that you can easily continue the next time you open it.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Dragon",slug:"dragon",image:"/images/book2net/Dragon.jpg",type:"A1 Book Scanner",overview:`The versatile V-shape scanning studio

The Dragon starts, where other scanning systems reach their limits

Even the sight of this scanning system, equipped with sophisticated technology, sends out a signal: This is the ultimate. When it comes to digitizing two-dimensional originals, the book2net Dragon is gold standard. It impresses with its high level of flexibility. Individual settings can be made precisely for each original, and standardized scan sequences can be defined to achieve high productivity without effort.

The Dragon can scan books in formats from A1 to A4 and is also suitable for particularly heavy copies: The book cradle can withstand 180 kilos and should therefore be able to cope with anything the user requires.

The Dragon is the ideal system for old, valuable books that need to be handled with the utmost care, but whose nuances, however subtle, need to be digitally preserved for future generations. Whether special inks and colors, gold grounds and gildings – every spot, every aspect of the pages is digitized true to the original. So, it's no wonder that the book2net Dragon was chosen for a particularly sensitive project at the National Library of Scotland, in which rare, illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages are being scanned.

To make working with the book2net Dragon easy, the system provides perfect technology and a high level of operating convenience: the cameras can be moved individually on slide rails and the setting angles can be changed as required. The LED lighting concept is also sophisticated: The dual lighting unit can be controlled individually or synchronously. Fresnel lenses ensure uniform illumination, and the light emission angle can be infinitely adjusted.

Then there is the book cradle, which is set to a book-friendly 110° as standard, but whose opening angle can be changed if required. It also has a book spine exemption – up to ten centimeters wide (optionally up to 20 cm) and up to eight centimeters deep. This ensures that even thick book spines can be digitized gently, without causing annoying bulges in the folding area. In addition, a continuously height-adjustable book spine support with a gentle surface prevents the book from "slipping through". The book cradle can also be easily raised and lowered using a motorized profile lifting column to ensure the same distance between the lens and the book at all times, regardless of how thick the latter is. A double LED positioning aid helps to position the book perfectly, while generous storage areas on both sides of the book cradle facilitate the work process.

On request, a non-reflective V-shape glass plate can be installed in the Dragon to smooth wavy book pages with gentle pressure. The adjustable pressure sensitivity, full electronic pressure control and integrated movement monitoring ensure the safety of both the valuable originals and the user.

Keyword lens: Schneider-Kreuznach precision lenses are fitted as standard, which produce distortion-free results with brilliant color accuracy and perfect linearity. However, for special requirements special lenses can be used as well. When it comes to cameras, there is a choice between the M70 and the M150, both of which are book2net quality products. The scanning time of 0.3 seconds shows that the Dragon also stands for enormous efficiency.

From the cameras and lenses to the lighting, the book cradle and the software, the book2net Dragon is a system that leaves nothing to be desired. You can benefit from the considerable productivity and at the same time be prepared for every individual case thanks to the flexibly adjustable technology. All this combined with a high level of user-friendliness. The Dragon is an all-round carefree package for anyone who wants to digitize historical treasures perfectly and gently.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Cobra",slug:"cobra",image:"/images/book2net/Cobra.jpg",type:"A1 Book Scanner",overview:`High-end V-scanner with semi-robotic

The best choice for your valuable collection

Actually, all old books, manuscripts and documents that are digitized in archives or libraries are valuable. Otherwise, they would not be kept, let alone scanned. But there are treasures that stand out among all these silent yet exciting witnesses to the past. The Gutenberg Bible, for example. Around 570 years old, it was the first book to be printed in movable type. There are only a few copies left, two of which are in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. Our book2net Cobra A2 was used to digitize these impressive and extremely sensitive works. The device was specially designed to carefully transport precious rare books and manuscripts, which should literally only be handled with kid gloves, into the digital world.

Everything about the book2net Cobra, which is available in A1 and A2 versions, is designed to ensure that these treasures of written and pictorial tradition are not damaged during scanning. The book cradle is equipped with an opening angle of 110°: The resulting V-shape makes it possible for even the most fragile books and manuscripts, which for conservation reasons may not be opened at an angle of 180°, to be digitized in the gentlest way. Damage to the binding and book spine is also prevented by the book spine exemption, which can be conveniently adapted to the respective original and can even accommodate books up to 20 cm thick.

The Cobra has two gentle pressure methods to ensure that the pages of the books do not close again during the scanning process but remain open. On the one hand, it can be operated with the permanently installed V-shaped non-reflective glass plate, whose pressure sensitivity and opening mode can be individually adjusted using various control modules.  This not only protects the books, but also saves the user unnecessary time during the scanning process.

However, if even this gentle glass pressure is too hard on an original, the Cobra can easily be operated without it. The V-shaped "butterfly system" with four Plexiglas pressure fingers is available for this purpose. It can be adapted to any book size and is synchronized with the scanning process so that it opens and closes automatically. If you want to work with the permanently installed glass plate again, you can simply remove it at any time. In the case of precious items for which even the "butterfly system" is not justifiable from a conservation point of view, the pages can be hold down purely manually using special tools developed by us.

While the V-shaped book cradle and glass plate ensure optimum book support, the camera and lighting technology of the book2net Cobra guarantee that the book pages can be captured evenly and without distortion right down to the depths of the book fold in the best quality.

With the book2net Cobra, two camera systems with high-resolution CMOS area sensors are used in parallel. This achieves unrivalled quality in the resolution rate. The customer can choose between using our M70 or M150 camera systems as required.

Another key element for image quality is the glare-free lighting unit, which is gentle on both the operator and the original. If old books and manuscripts are exposed to high light intensity, biochemical processes can be triggered – depending on the duration and light intensity – that lead to structural changes in the paper, ink and color, causing irreparable damage. It is therefore essential to keep both the light intensity and the exposure time as low as possible during the scanning process.

The book2net Cobra works with an extremely reduced exposure time of 0.5 seconds at a scanning speed of just 0.3 seconds. The lighting module specially developed for the book2net Cobra also makes it possible to adapt the illumination to conservation requirements and reduce it to a light intensity of <= 2500 lux.

In addition, valuable old books such as illuminated manuscripts can pose special challenges for digitization: waved surfaces, special inks and colors, especially gold grounds and gildings often require more than standard lighting to achieve a perfect shadow- and reflection-free result. For this purpose, the book2net Cobra has additional lighting that can be integrated, mounted or controlled externally as required. The lighting units can be operated individually and synchronously, and thanks to the Fresnel lenses, the illumination is absolutely uniform.

All components of the book2net Cobra are designed to digitize the most valuable books in the gentlest way and in the best quality. As a floor-standing device that can be operated comfortably from a seated position and has a wide range of control modules for operation by hand or foot control, it also guarantees smooth ergonomic operation. All this in combination with high productivity and the robustness and reliability you have come to expect from us. This means you can tackle even those projects where very special treasures need to be transferred from the analog to the digital world without breaking a sweat.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Archive Pro A1",slug:"archive-pro-a1",image:"/images/book2net/Archive-Pro-A1.jpg",type:"A1 Archive Scanner",overview:`Ergonomics, ease of use & quality

Outstanding features to suit your requirements

Anyone working in an archive has to deal with exciting and revealing treasures from the past, with bound or stapled documents, with individual paper pages, with large and small formats, with smooth or corrugated surfaces. If you want to digitize all of this to make it available to people now and in the future, you need a scanning system that you can rely on and that is just as versatile as the originals that need to be digitized. The solution: the book2net Archive Pro.

This scanner is available in A1 and A2 versions. Of course, the Archive Pro is also ideal for transferring small formats to the digital world. To do this, the camera simply moves up close and within a few seconds a true-to-original image with clear resolution is created, everything is sharp, and the colors remain unaltered. This applies to any format. Keyword camera: You can choose whether the Archive Pro should be equipped with our M70 or M150 camera version.

The Archive Pro has three large LED lights − one at the back, one on the left and one on the right. Let's assume we place a thick book with a deep fold on the book cradle. If we want to avoid casting shadows, the book is only illuminated from above with the rear light. If, on the other hand, the right or left page is to be "staged" with raking light, it is advisable to illuminate only the right or left side. However, if you want to illuminate the entire original evenly, all three lights are needed.

While the camera slider and the lights are the quality guarantors in the upper area of the Archive Pro, the glass plate and the book cradle in the lower area ensure that excellent results are achieved. As with the other book2net production scanners, the book cradle of the Archive Pro also compensates for the weight and thickness of the book and thus ensures that the surface of a double-page book is always on the same level during the scanning process. The Archive Pro is also equipped with special features: As an extra, both sides of the book cradle can be controlled separately. In addition, the book cradle can be moved against the glass plate from below to save time and effort.

And finally, not to be neglected: the user comfort. The camera slider and book cradle have already been mentioned. The glass plate – non-reflective, of course – can be used in different ways depending on requirements, whether in a fixed position, self-opening or individually adjustable with the help of an electric motor. Another important feature is that you can see what the digital copy will look like on the screen. The user therefore always has full control.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Reprosystem",slug:"reprosystem",image:"/images/book2net/Reprosystem.jpg",type:"Versatile & scalable reprographic studio",overview:`The versatile solution to meet your requirements

Versatile is perhaps the most appropriate word to describe our book2net reprographic studio. With this device, all formats from A6 to A0 can be digitized, regardless of whether a book, a loose page, a photo, a poster or an object such as a coin is placed on the support table. The reprographic system is therefore particularly interesting for archives and museums, which often store a veritable smorgasbord of documents and objects.

What immediately catches the eye is the camera slider, which can extend the distance between the support table and the lens to up to 1.80 meters. This means that even particularly large formats can be scanned. If you want to digitize a small piece of paper or even a stamp after a poster, for example, you simply let the camera slide downwards, close to the object. Incidentally, there are three ways to do this: the cheapest is a crank, which is used to manually adjust the height of the camera, more convenient is the adjustment at the touch of a button, and the "gold standard" is the software, which recognizes what is on the support table and adjusts the camera correctly without the user having to do anything. Whichever option you choose, the quality of the result is always the same, always excellent.

Why is the perfect distance between the camera and the original so important? With large formats, it is obvious that the distance must be correspondingly large to fully capture a poster, for example. However, if it is something small, such as a stamp, the resolution would suffer greatly if the distance to the camera were unnecessarily large. Thanks to the camera slider, the reprographic studio does not "give away" any quality but achieves the best possible result.

Keyword quality: for it to be perfect, the lighting needs to be just right. This is also provided by the system. The two LED daylight lights ensure soft and even illumination. The diffuser panels on the LED lights contribute to this and prevent shadows being cast, which could occur with three-dimensional objects such as a coin.

The high-performance area sensor and the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens are further pillars of the reprographic system, which ensure that the digital image looks exactly like the original, right down to the last corner. No distortions, no blurring, no color divergences.

Speaking of versatility: we offer this system with our own M70 or M150 cameras, but third-party cameras such as the Sony Alpha or the Fuji GFX can also be integrated without any problems. The size of the support table is also variable. You can choose between the maximum formats A1, A2 and A3. A0 is also possible on request.

The versatility goes even further, because if you opt for a book2net repro system, you can buy a few extras or add them later. Depending on the project, a light table – in various formats, of course – and a support for slides or glass negatives can be practical aids. This also applies to the book holder and many other extras that are compatible with our reprographic studio.

Anyone who opts for this scanning system therefore receives a tailor-made solution that can be individually expanded. This wealth of variants is coupled with quality criteria that characterize all our devices: effective work with a robust device, excellent results, simple operation. In other words, with the book2net reprographic studio you will have enormous added value and great pleasure.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Flash",slug:"flash",image:"/images/book2net/Flash.jpg",type:"A1 high-performance scanner",overview:`Robust design & reliable performance

Anyone who wants to digitize heavy volumes of newspapers double-page by double-page will be pleased if modern technology makes it much faster and the scanner is easy and convenient to use. In the Irish Newspaper Archives, for example, the reliable services of the book2net Flash are greatly appreciated. Millions of newspaper pages of various titles from a period of over 200 years have already been digitally archived – also thanks to the Flash, which does not stand for tedious work, but for fast and smooth workflow.

The book2net Flash was created especially for large formats up to A1, which also have a considerable weight. The newspaper volumes mentioned above are a good example. High productivity and workplace ergonomics are key elements that we attach great importance to. Added to this is the outstanding quality of the digital copies and the gentle handling of the books and other originals, which are placed on the book cradle or – optionally – on the fixed support table.

How does the Flash ensure that the user can work as comfortably and quickly as possible? A key component of this scanning system is the double lifting column, which ensures that the height of the book is equalized. This means that no matter which page is open, the correct lifting column always goes down just far enough so that the surface of the double page to be scanned forms exactly one level. Height compensation of up to 25 centimeters is possible. This is also the size of the book spine exemption, which can accommodate the binding of particularly thick books. This all serves to ensure that the area sensor, which detects all areas simultaneously, hits a level. This is further enhanced by the motorized glass plate, which lies gently on the original, creating no reflections and damaging nothing.

Precise positioning on the book cradle is one factor that leads to the perfect result. Other factors are the technical elements located in the upper section of the device. For example, the aforementioned area sensor, which, with its simultaneous detection of all areas, not only ensures high quality, but also works much faster than if it were to scan slowly – like a line sensor, for example – over the original. A scanning time of 0.3 seconds and a total processing time of 2.2 seconds speak for themselves. The Schneider-Kreuznach lens and the adjustable double illumination unit are further guarantees for excellent results.

All these weighty arguments in favor of investing in the book2net Flash are underpinned by further strengths: The camera used is also a book2net product, and you can choose between the M70 and the M150. The software makes working even more convenient, for example, scan sequences can be programmed. What's more, the Flash is quiet and energy-saving and – as you would expect from our products – extremely robust and durable.

The book2net Flash is the perfect choice for anyone who wants high productivity, simple operation, a comfortable workstation and excellent results when dealing with huge volumes of material to be digitized. Large formats, small effort – a relaxed way to reach your goal.`,categories:["A1","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A1"}]},{name:"Archive Pro A2",slug:"archive-pro-a2",image:"/images/book2net/A21.jpg",type:"A2 Archive Scanner",overview:`Ergonomics, ease of use & quality

Actually, all old books, manuscripts and documents that are digitized in archives or libraries are valuable. Otherwise, they would not be kept, let alone scanned. But there are treasures that stand out among all these silent yet exciting witnesses to the past. The Gutenberg Bible, for example. Around 570 years old, it was the first book to be printed in movable type. There are only a few copies left, two of which are in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. Our book2net Cobra A2 was used to digitize these impressive and extremely sensitive works. The device was specially designed to carefully transport precious rare books and manuscripts, which should literally only be handled with kid gloves, into the digital world.

Everything about the book2net Cobra, which is available in A1 and A2 versions, is designed to ensure that these treasures of written and pictorial tradition are not damaged during scanning. The book cradle is equipped with an opening angle of 110°: The resulting V-shape makes it possible for even the most fragile books and manuscripts, which for conservation reasons may not be opened at an angle of 180°, to be digitized in the gentlest way. Damage to the binding and book spine is also prevented by the book spine exemption, which can be conveniently adapted to the respective original and can even accommodate books up to 20 cm thick.

The Cobra has two gentle pressure methods to ensure that the pages of the books do not close again during the scanning process but remain open. On the one hand, it can be operated with the permanently installed V-shaped non-reflective glass plate, whose pressure sensitivity and opening mode can be individually adjusted using various control modules.  This not only protects the books, but also saves the user unnecessary time during the scanning process.

However, if even this gentle glass pressure is too hard on an original, the Cobra can easily be operated without it. The V-shaped "butterfly system" with four Plexiglas pressure fingers is available for this purpose. It can be adapted to any book size and is synchronized with the scanning process so that it opens and closes automatically. If you want to work with the permanently installed glass plate again, you can simply remove it at any time. In the case of precious items for which even the "butterfly system" is not justifiable from a conservation point of view, the pages can be hold down purely manually using special tools developed by us.

While the V-shaped book cradle and glass plate ensure optimum book support, the camera and lighting technology of the book2net Cobra guarantee that the book pages can be captured evenly and without distortion right down to the depths of the book fold in the best quality.

With the book2net Cobra, two camera systems with high-resolution CMOS area sensors are used in parallel. This achieves unrivalled quality in the resolution rate. The customer can choose between using our M70 or M150 camera systems as required.

Another key element for image quality is the glare-free lighting unit, which is gentle on both the operator and the original. If old books and manuscripts are exposed to high light intensity, biochemical processes can be triggered – depending on the duration and light intensity – that lead to structural changes in the paper, ink and color, causing irreparable damage. It is therefore essential to keep both the light intensity and the exposure time as low as possible during the scanning process.

The book2net Cobra works with an extremely reduced exposure time of 0.5 seconds at a scanning speed of just 0.3 seconds. The lighting module specially developed for the book2net Cobra also makes it possible to adapt the illumination to conservation requirements and reduce it to a light intensity of <= 2500 lux.

In addition, valuable old books such as illuminated manuscripts can pose special challenges for digitization: waved surfaces, special inks and colors, especially gold grounds and gildings often require more than standard lighting to achieve a perfect shadow- and reflection-free result. For this purpose, the book2net Cobra has additional lighting that can be integrated, mounted or controlled externally as required. The lighting units can be operated individually and synchronously, and thanks to the Fresnel lenses, the illumination is absolutely uniform.

All components of the book2net Cobra are designed to digitize the most valuable books in the gentlest way and in the best quality. As a floor-standing device that can be operated comfortably from a seated position and has a wide range of control modules for operation by hand or foot control, it also guarantees smooth ergonomic operation. All this in combination with high productivity and the robustness and reliability you have come to expect from us. This means you can tackle even those projects where very special treasures need to be transferred from the analog to the digital world without breaking a sweat.`,categories:["A2","V-SHAPE","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Folio",slug:"folio",image:"/images/book2net/A23.jpg",type:"A2 Book scanner beyond DIN standards",overview:`The book scanner beyond DIN standards

High quality for exceptional formats

Formats such as DIN A4, DIN A3, DIN A2 etc. have been standard for decades, especially in the European cultural area. However, if you go back centuries or look outside Europe, you will come across book and document formats that differ considerably from these standards.

However, since digitization should not fail due to the format, the technology must be versatile. Although this applies to all our scanning systems, the book2net Folio is specially designed for the digitization of different portrait and landscape formats beyond the DIN standard. The layout surface for originals up to 523 x 736 millimeters leaves nothing to be desired. Historical book and newspaper formats, church or civil records, technical and architectural drawings, maps, posters, engravings, scores and more are easily captured by the Folio and saved for future generations in brilliant resolution and perfect color reproduction.

Conceptually, the book2net Folio follows on from our extraordinarily successful series of book2net Kiosk Public and book2net Kiosk Pro scanners. It inherits all the qualities of this series, which our customers regard as exceptionally robust, reliable, user-friendly and durable.

The book2net Folio features the proven book2net standards such as a high-resolution CMOS area sensor, a document-friendly book cradle with removable Makrolon® pressure plate and a gentle LED lighting system. If required, a screen can also be integrated for direct control of the scanning processes. A V-scanner version with flexibly adjustable book support is also available on request.

With the book2net Folio, the buyer thus receives a variable, space-saving and cost-effective alternative to our production scanners, enabling them to carry out large-volume projects even on a small budget. Whether in libraries or archives – the book2net Folio creates added value that buyers of this scanning system will enjoy for a long time.`,categories:["A2","BOOK SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Hybrid Scanning Solution A2",slug:"hybrid-scanning-solution-a2",image:"/images/book2net/A24.jpg",type:"A2 Hybrid Scanner",overview:`Two devices – one software

A must in every digitization center

It's not easy to work carefully and gently while making rapid progress. Or is it? The hybrid scanning solution from book2net makes exactly that possible. In archives and libraries, you have to deal with very diverse collections: centuries-old, fragile and porous documents and books on the one hand, and masses of documents in stacks and boxes that seem almost impossible to process on the other. Digitizing all this is a challenge that requires a system you can rely on. Or even better: two systems.

The hybrid scanning solution from book2net combines the advantages of two "scanning worlds": contactless, gentle digitization by our overhead scanners in formats up to A1 with the efficiency of the SCAMIG document scanner specially designed for us, which can handle documents up to A3 in size.

The overhead scanner takes care of the gentle digitization of books, fragile documents or objects such as seals. It is easy to operate and guarantees excellent image quality. As a congenial partner, the SCAMIG is entrusted with robust individual pages or entire stacks of documents, which are fed and digitized much faster than could be achieved with an overhead scanner. But speed is not everything, because the SCAMIG also handles the sheets with care, as the patented belt transport is particularly gentle. The speed of the document feeder can also be reduced. And you can use the rear output tray for thicker paper or cardboard, for example, so that the document is not turned over in the device.

But how exactly does the application of the systems work in practice in the digitization process? Both devices are connected to the same computer. We are happy to provide a specially designed PC for this purpose. The advantage: all devices come from a single source and there is only one contact person. If you prefer to use your own computer, that is also possible. The software is then installed there.

The scans from the SCAMIG document scanner are also saved via the software of the overhead scanner and are available there for further processing and organization. Regardless of which scanner is currently in use, the documents are saved in the correct order. Thanks to the multi-page option, it is possible to save several documents in one file. The job function is also particularly convenient, as it can be used to save settings made for a project so that you can easily continue the next time you open it.`,categories:["A2","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Kiosk Light A2+",slug:"kiosk-light-a2",image:"/images/book2net/A25.jpg",type:"A2+ Efficient, versatile & flexible scanner",overview:`Efficient, versatile & flexible

The suitable scanner for the archive sector

The Kiosk Light is ideal for anyone for whom easy operation, high-quality results, speed and security are important. This scanner is the perfect alternative to the copier, which it beats by far in many respects. Anyone who spends a lot of time in reading rooms will be familiar with the procedures at the photocopier. You place a more or less thick book on it, copy the double page, lift it up, turn the page and have the next double page copied. This takes time and the result leaves a lot to be desired. The book fold is difficult to capture, so the copy is often quite dark in the middle and the writing is distorted.

In addition to a great loss of time and poor quality, there is a third problem: putting a thick book "upside down" and having it intensively illuminated damages the cover and the book pages. If you use our Kiosk Light, on the other hand, you don't have these problems. Instead, there are lots of advantages.

What makes this scanner stand out? First of all, it is easy to use, which is why it is particularly suitable for use in archives and public libraries and can be used by anyone. Then there's the quality: the camera we developed ourselves, the high-performance matrix sensors, LED lighting and Fresnel lenses ensure outstanding results that look like the original. The camera is mounted vertically above the book or page to be scanned, so distortions cannot occur. Every spot is captured precisely and saved in true detail and color. Everything happens very quickly: the scan is completed within 0.3 seconds, and scanning, transferring and saving together take just 2.2 seconds.

Another important component of the Kiosk Light is the book table. The book is placed on the table with the pages to be scanned facing upwards – in a different and gentler way than with a photocopier.

Not to forget: the uniform LED lighting, which hits the object at a 45-degree angle and therefore also produces no reflection, because the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection.

Achieving optimal, true-to-original results quickly, reliably and easily – our Kiosk Light is the perfect scanner for everyone. Those who use it do not need to be experts but can simply enjoy the convenience that the Kiosk Light brings.`,categories:["A2","PUBLIC USE SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2+"}]},{name:"Kiosk Pro A2+",slug:"kiosk-pro-a2",image:"/images/book2net/A26.jpg",type:"A2+ Innovative, versatile & efficient scanner",overview:`Innovative, versatile & efficient

The all-purpose A2 scanner

Anyone who works in an archive or library has to deal with thick and thin books, with intact and badly damaged bindings, with smooth and wrinkled pages, with folders and individual sheets. And with extremely fragile documents. It is important to digitize these heterogeneous collections in order to preserve the content and enable access from anywhere at any time. To do this, you need a scanner that digitizes different formats in consistently high quality, is easy to use and very fast. Of course, the book or document must be protected in the process. All these factors are combined in our Kiosk Pro A2+.

Various technical components are crucial to ensure that the digitized copy looks exactly like the original. Firstly, there is the sensor, which performs a 3D analysis of the page to detect whether the paper is wrinkled, for example. The high-quality camera, together with the LED lighting including Fresnel lenses, transports the document or book page into the digital world.

The exact results are also thanks to the book cradle. The Kiosk Pro A2+ has a self-adjusting book cradle to ensure that the double page of a thick book lies completely on one level and that the distance to the camera is the same everywhere.

Scanning with the Kiosk Pro A2+ is completed within 0.2 seconds, and scanning, transferring and saving take just 2.0 seconds in total. As an option, the Kiosk Pro A2+ can also be equipped with a 24-inch screen on which the future result can already be viewed even before the document has been scanned. This preview option is just as much a plus point of the device as the zoom function on the display. The software ensures that nothing gets mixed up.`,categories:["A2","PUBLIC USE SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2+"}]},{name:"Kiosk Public A2+",slug:"kiosk-public-a2",image:"/images/book2net/A27.jpg",type:"A2+ Innovative, precise & fast scanner",overview:`Innovative, precise & fast

The pioneering classic

The Kiosk Public is ideal for anyone for whom easy operation, high-quality results, speed and security are important. This scanner is the perfect alternative to the copier, which it beats by far in many respects. Anyone who spends a lot of time in reading rooms will be familiar with the procedures at the photocopier.

Everything happens very quickly: the scan is completed within 0.2 seconds, and scanning, transferring and saving together take just 2.0 seconds.

Another important component of the Kiosk Public is the book cradle. The book is placed on the cradle with the pages to be scanned facing upwards – in a different and gentler way than with a photocopier. To ensure that the double pages are exactly at the same height, regardless of whether you want to scan page 12 or page 583, the cradle moves downwards with the "thicker half of the book". The cradle does this automatically. In addition, the distance between the two plates of the book cradle can be adjusted so that there is room for book spines up to ten centimetres wide between them. All this ensures that the double page to be scanned lies completely on one level.

Not to forget: the uniform LED lighting, which hits the object at a 45-degree angle and therefore also produces no reflection, because the angle of incidence is the same as the angle of reflection.

Finally – due to the high frequency of use in reading rooms – it should be mentioned that the Kiosk Public is a very robust scanner that is also very economical in terms of energy consumption.

Non-contact analysis of drawings, archival materials and documents

If a document is scanned perfectly, the digital copy is captured true to the original down to the last corner. There are no poorly lit areas, no blurring, no discoloration. The book2net products stand for precisely this quality. The book2net multispectral system goes one step further: it delves into the depths of the original, making visible what cannot be seen with the naked eye.

In addition to creating a high-quality digital image, this scanning system analyzes structures and material. By using infrared or UV light, areas can be made visible that would remain hidden without this technology. Depending on what exactly you want to make visible, different wavebands are set.

For example, watermarks and paper structures can be highlighted, or the material used to write a text, draw a sketch or paint a work of art can be analyzed. Even foxing stains, ageing processes of the paper or old restorations can be made visible quickly and easily thanks to the sophisticated technology of the book2net multispectral system.

The system not only fulfills the task of making cultural heritage limitlessly available to future generations through digitization but is also a stroke of luck for research. With little effort, a variety of "layers" of the original can be made visible at an enormous speed.

The easy-to-use software leaves nothing to be desired and should please every user. It is easy to create several digital images of the same original with different capturing scenarios in order to make different aspects visible at the same time: While, for example, one image highlights the watermark, another displays restored parts of the paper and a third shows all areas where, for example, carbonized material has been used for writing or drawing. The software allows these images to be superimposed with pixel precision, added or subtracted as it were, in order to carry out specific scientific investigations.

In addition to the material analysis itself, a particular highlight is that no filter change is necessary, as the camera works without any filters at all! This avoids any physical intervention in the device, so there are no vibrations that could impair the quality of the scan result. Everything runs smoothly, quickly and easily via the software.

Renowned institutions such as the Klassik Stiftung Weimar are already using the book2net multispectral system to scientifically examine their art treasures, e.g. the drawings by Albrecht Dürer, Leonardo da Vinci, Lucas Cranach and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In this way, valuable works of art are secured for the future on the one hand, and new insights into their condition, necessary restoration measures, creation processes, authorship and authenticity are gained on the other.

All of this makes the multispectral system interesting not only as a cultural science tool for museums, archives and libraries, but also as a testing instrument for other areas of application, such as legal and forensic.`,categories:["A2","MUSEUM SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Reprographic Studio A2",slug:"reprographic-studio-a2",image:"/images/book2net/A29.jpg",type:"A2 Versatile & scalable reprographic studio",overview:`Versatile & scalable

The versatile solution to meet your requirements

Versatile is perhaps the most appropriate word to describe our book2net reprographic studio. With this device, all formats from A6 to A0 can be digitized, regardless of whether a book, a loose page, a photo, a poster or an object such as a coin is placed on the support table. The reprographic system is therefore particularly interesting for archives and museums, which often store a veritable smorgasbord of documents and objects.

What immediately catches the eye is the camera slider, which can extend the distance between the support table and the lens to up to 1.80 meters. This means that even particularly large formats can be scanned. If you want to digitize a small piece of paper or even a stamp after a poster, for example, you simply let the camera slide downwards, close to the object. Incidentally, there are three ways to do this: the cheapest is a crank, which is used to manually adjust the height of the camera, more convenient is the adjustment at the touch of a button, and the "gold standard" is the software, which recognizes what is on the support table and adjusts the camera correctly without the user having to do anything. Whichever option you choose, the quality of the result is always the same, always excellent.

Why is the perfect distance between the camera and the original so important? With large formats, it is obvious that the distance must be correspondingly large to fully capture a poster, for example. However, if it is something small, such as a stamp, the resolution would suffer greatly if the distance to the camera were unnecessarily large. Thanks to the camera slider, the reprographic studio does not "give away" any quality but achieves the best possible result.

Keyword quality: for it to be perfect, the lighting needs to be just right. This is also provided by the system. The two LED daylight lights ensure soft and even illumination. The diffuser panels on the LED lights contribute to this and prevent shadows being cast, which could occur with three-dimensional objects such as a coin.

The high-performance area sensor and the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens are further pillars of the reprographic system, which ensure that the digital image looks exactly like the original, right down to the last corner. No distortions, no blurring, no color divergences.

Speaking of versatility: we offer this system with our own M70 or M150 cameras, but third-party cameras such as the Sony Alpha or the Fuji GFX can also be integrated without any problems. The size of the support table is also variable. You can choose between the maximum formats A1, A2 and A3. A0 is also possible on request.

The versatility goes even further, because if you opt for a book2net repro system, you can buy a few extras or add them later. Depending on the project, a light table – in various formats, of course – and a support for slides or glass negatives can be practical aids. This also applies to the book holder and many other extras that are compatible with our reprographic studio.

Anyone who opts for this scanning system therefore receives a tailor-made solution that can be individually expanded. This wealth of variants is coupled with quality criteria that characterize all our devices: effective work with a robust device, excellent results, simple operation. In other words, with the book2net reprographic studio you will have enormous added value and great pleasure.`,categories:["A2","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Ultra 2+",slug:"ultra-2-plus",image:"/images/book2net/A291.jpg",type:"A2 high-performance scanner",overview:`Advanced A2 scanning solution for professional digitization

None is faster

Not everything is always in one place. Then it's good to be flexible. Just like with our book2net Falcon, a scanner that is specially designed to change its location time and again. It combines the usual high quality of book2net systems with the ability to easily transport the device from A to B. This avoids exposing old, fragile books to a "journey" that could damage them.

For instance, our book2net Falcon was used in a digitization project in Greece, where the documents to be captured are located on various islands. We also sent several Falcons to Centra Asia for a project of the Uzbek Ministry of Justice, in which the documents are spread across 248 different locations, so that the documents can be conveniently digitized on site. Both projects demonstrate the enormous flexibility of this scanning system, which simply needs to be unpacked and connected to a computer. The practical "box shape" has a second effect: it shields outside light that could interfere with the scanning process.

As simple as the Falcon is to use, as finely tuned is its technology and as excellent are the results it produces – and this, by the way, in formats up to DIN A2.The book2net Falcon is specially designed for books that are particularly sensitive and therefore must not be opened too wide, as otherwise damage to the binding could occur.This is why the support plates, which can be individually moved and locked in place, form a V – as is familiar from some other book2net scanning systems. Thus, the book cradle protects the book and at the same time ensures that the pages are illuminated at the optimum angle. With 15 cm in width, the book spine exemption prevents damage in this particularly sensitive area.

The Falcon is also equipped with a V-shaped glass plate, that can be gently placed on the double page of the book manually using a spring system. This results in an absolutely flat surface, which, in combination with the high-performance sensor, the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens, the LED lighting and the Fresnel lenses, ensures optimum and therefore faithful results. It goes without saying that the glass plate is anti-reflective.

Thanks to sophisticated technology, results are achieved with reliable color accuracy and without distortion. The device itself and the associated software allow you to work quickly and conveniently. What's more, the book2net Falcon is a robust device, produces hardly any noise, avoids heat pollution and is energy-saving. The scanning time of 0.3 seconds is just as impressive as the 2.2 seconds that the device needs for the whole process of scanning, imaging and saving. Productivity is therefore another plus point that the Falcon has to offer.

The book2net Falcon is the perfect choice for anyone who wants to achieve high-quality results while making work easy and avoiding the need to transport sensitive books and documents from different sites to a central location. The perfect companion for both regional and global projects.`,categories:["A3","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Hybrid Scanning Solution",slug:"hybrid-scanning-solution-a3",image:"/images/book2net/A32.jpg",type:"A3 Hybrid Scanner",overview:`Two devices – one software

High performance meets maximum care

Miles of shelves, one next to the other, all quite high and packed with old documents. Endless individual pages, sometimes thin paper, sometimes cardboard, sometimes well preserved, sometimes porous, sometimes large format, sometimes small. Digitizing all these "witnesses to the past" is a mammoth task. Hence, you want a scanner that is fast, protects the originals and is also easy to use. The solution is called SCAMIG. We offer this high-performance scanner in the "120" and "210" versions, where the number stands for the maximum possible scans per minute.

At first glance, the SCAMIG looks like a printer, but in fact it is so much more. The basic principle: the individual pages are fed in one after the other, turned and come out at the top. There is also an output tray at the back, which is used if you want to digitize thick documents – or if the condition of the paper is precarious. Hence, a particularly gentle option. However, despite its enormous speed, the SCAMIG, whether in the 120 or 210 version, always takes every single document into consideration. This is due both to the paper-friendly belt transport and the option to reduce the feed speed, especially for sensitive documents.

Which document is to be output via the rear tray can be controlled with a barcode, which is printed on an extra page and placed as a placeholder in the corresponding position in the stack. The device recognizes what needs to be done and at the same time ensures that the digitized documents remain in the correct order.

As you would expect from book2net, the SCAMIG is a high-quality device that is also paired with user-friendly and versatile software. Image processing is carried out directly on the scanner, for which a 7-inch touchscreen is available.

Investing in a SCAMIG 120 is particularly worthwhile for archives. In addition to the reasons already mentioned, there are two other important arguments: Firstly, the SCAMIG 120 can be upgraded to cope with increasing scan volumes. You can buy it in the version with up to 100 scans per minute and have it upgraded later to handle up to 120 scans per minute. Alternatively, you can opt for the 120-scan version straight away. Secondly, book2net offers the SCAMIG 120 as part of a hybrid scanning solution.This means that it can be ideally combined with our overhead scanners. The two devices can be combined into one system and together they cover everything that the archivist wants to transport into the digital world. Here the SCAMIG, which scans the individual pages at high speed, and there the overhead scanner, which is particularly effective with large and small formats and books. Together they work perfectly. Uncomplicated, fast, gentle – and the correct sequence is retained on the digital level.

Anyone who has a SCAMIG at their disposal should no longer be sweating when they look at the long, packed archive shelves. Because everything is possible: fast, secure, convenient and in the usual excellent book2net quality.`,categories:["A3","DOCUMENT SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Speed",value:"120 pages/min"}]},{name:"SCAMIG 210",slug:"scamig-210",image:"/images/book2net/A35.jpg",type:"High-performance document scanner",overview:`Compact and powerful

The innovative entry-level class

The book2net Spirit can be described as small but mighty, but the attributes of low cost, user-friendly and high quality should also be added. The Spirit is particularly suitable for public libraries and archives, as it is both robust and easy to use. It can take over the function of a copier but delivers results at a much higher level.

If a book page does not fill the space on the copier, thick black stripes "decorate" the book page. Beautiful is different. If something is crooked, it is copied crooked. That's not clean either. With the Spirit, which digitizes formats up to DIN A3, the software ensures that only the sheet or the book page itself is scanned. If something is not lying correctly, it is straightened by the software.

Speaking of automatic: the book2net Spirit recognizes how intense or weak the ambient light is and adjusts the exposure time accordingly. This device has its own LED light source, but you don't necessarily have to use it. However, if you want to achieve perfect results, it is a natural choice. The Fresnel lenses ensure homogeneous illumination, while the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens achieves an enormous depth of field, resulting in digitized images of excellent quality. This also applies to the authenticity of the colors.

Incidentally, this happens at an enormous speed, as a scan only takes 0.2 seconds, and within 2.2 seconds the document is not only scanned but also saved. You can save each page individually, even if you scan a double page "in one go". Thanks to the sophisticated software, the user can access a logical file structure afterwards.

Other important advantages of the Spirit are the 24-inch touchscreen and the option to edit the digital image afterwards if you wish. Although this is not necessary in terms of quality, you may want to delete an area of the document or image or add annotations to a scanned text.

If you opt for the book2net Spirit, you can choose whether you prefer the device as an embedded system with an integrated PC or with external PC access. There is also a choice between the book cradle and a fixed support table. Due to its flexibility, the book cradle holds the surface of a book to be scanned on one level so that the original is captured in the best possible way, regardless of whether the book is open to page 5 or page 500.

As the book2net Spirit demonstrates its advantages particularly in publicly accessible areas, the security system naturally plays a major role. You can rely on this system, as the device's hard disk is inaccessible to attacks.

All in all, the Spirit enables every user to work comfortably and quickly with results of the highest quality. The small, robust and energy-saving scanner creates added value in every library and archive in many ways. If you want to afford it, you don't need a big budget.`,categories:["A3","BOOK SCANNERS","PUBLIC USE SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A3"}]},{name:"Archive Pro A2",slug:"archive-pro-a2",image:"/images/book2net/Archive-Pro-A1.jpg",type:"A2 Archive Scanner",overview:`Ergonomics, ease of use & quality

Outstanding features to suit your requirements

Anyone working in an archive has to deal with exciting and revealing treasures from the past, with bound or stapled documents, with individual paper pages, with large and small formats, with smooth or corrugated surfaces. If you want to digitize all of this to make it available to people now and in the future, you need a scanning system that you can rely on and that is just as versatile as the originals that need to be digitized. The solution: the book2net Archive Pro.

This scanner is available in A1 and A2 versions. Of course, the Archive Pro is also ideal for transferring small formats to the digital world. To do this, the camera simply moves up close and within a few seconds a true-to-original image with clear resolution is created, everything is sharp, and the colors remain unaltered. This applies to any format. Keyword camera: You can choose whether the Archive Pro should be equipped with our M70 or M150 camera version.

The Archive Pro has three large LED lights − one at the back, one on the left and one on the right. Let's assume we place a thick book with a deep fold on the book cradle. If we want to avoid casting shadows, the book is only illuminated from above with the rear light. If, on the other hand, the right or left page is to be "staged" with raking light, it is advisable to illuminate only the right or left side. However, if you want to illuminate the entire original evenly, all three lights are needed.

While the camera slider and the lights are the quality guarantors in the upper area of the Archive Pro, the glass plate and the book cradle in the lower area ensure that excellent results are achieved. As with the other book2net production scanners, the book cradle of the Archive Pro also compensates for the weight and thickness of the book and thus ensures that the surface of a double-page book is always on the same level during the scanning process. The Archive Pro is also equipped with special features: As an extra, both sides of the book cradle can be controlled separately. In addition, the book cradle can be moved against the glass plate from below to save time and effort.

And finally, not to be neglected: the user comfort. The camera slider and book cradle have already been mentioned. The glass plate – non-reflective, of course – can be used in different ways depending on requirements, whether in a fixed position, self-opening or individually adjustable with the help of an electric motor. Another important feature is that you can see what the digital copy will look like on the screen. The user therefore always has full control.`,categories:["A2","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS","ARCHIVE SCANNERS","BOOK SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Cobra A2",slug:"cobra-a2",image:"/images/book2net/Cobra.jpg",type:"A2 Book Scanner",overview:`High-end V-scanner with semi-robotic

The best choice for your valuable collection

Actually, all old books, manuscripts and documents that are digitized in archives or libraries are valuable. Otherwise, they would not be kept, let alone scanned. But there are treasures that stand out among all these silent yet exciting witnesses to the past. The Gutenberg Bible, for example. Around 570 years old, it was the first book to be printed in movable type. There are only a few copies left, two of which are in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. Our book2net Cobra A2 was used to digitize these impressive and extremely sensitive works. The device was specially designed to carefully transport precious rare books and manuscripts, which should literally only be handled with kid gloves, into the digital world.

Everything about the book2net Cobra, which is available in A1 and A2 versions, is designed to ensure that these treasures of written and pictorial tradition are not damaged during scanning. The book cradle is equipped with an opening angle of 110°: The resulting V-shape makes it possible for even the most fragile books and manuscripts, which for conservation reasons may not be opened at an angle of 180°, to be digitized in the gentlest way. Damage to the binding and book spine is also prevented by the book spine exemption, which can be conveniently adapted to the respective original and can even accommodate books up to 20 cm thick.

The Cobra has two gentle pressure methods to ensure that the pages of the books do not close again during the scanning process but remain open. On the one hand, it can be operated with the permanently installed V-shaped non-reflective glass plate, whose pressure sensitivity and opening mode can be individually adjusted using various control modules.  This not only protects the books, but also saves the user unnecessary time during the scanning process.

However, if even this gentle glass pressure is too hard on an original, the Cobra can easily be operated without it. The V-shaped "butterfly system" with four Plexiglas pressure fingers is available for this purpose. It can be adapted to any book size and is synchronized with the scanning process so that it opens and closes automatically. If you want to work with the permanently installed glass plate again, you can simply remove it at any time. In the case of precious items for which even the "butterfly system" is not justifiable from a conservation point of view, the pages can be hold down purely manually using special tools developed by us.

While the V-shaped book cradle and glass plate ensure optimum book support, the camera and lighting technology of the book2net Cobra guarantee that the book pages can be captured evenly and without distortion right down to the depths of the book fold in the best quality.

With the book2net Cobra, two camera systems with high-resolution CMOS area sensors are used in parallel. This achieves unrivalled quality in the resolution rate. The customer can choose between using our M70 or M150 camera systems as required.

Another key element for image quality is the glare-free lighting unit, which is gentle on both the operator and the original. If old books and manuscripts are exposed to high light intensity, biochemical processes can be triggered – depending on the duration and light intensity – that lead to structural changes in the paper, ink and color, causing irreparable damage. It is therefore essential to keep both the light intensity and the exposure time as low as possible during the scanning process.

The book2net Cobra works with an extremely reduced exposure time of 0.5 seconds at a scanning speed of just 0.3 seconds. The lighting module specially developed for the book2net Cobra also makes it possible to adapt the illumination to conservation requirements and reduce it to a light intensity of <= 2500 lux.

In addition, valuable old books such as illuminated manuscripts can pose special challenges for digitization: waved surfaces, special inks and colors, especially gold grounds and gildings often require more than standard lighting to achieve a perfect shadow- and reflection-free result. For this purpose, the book2net Cobra has additional lighting that can be integrated, mounted or controlled externally as required. The lighting units can be operated individually and synchronously, and thanks to the Fresnel lenses, the illumination is absolutely uniform.

All components of the book2net Cobra are designed to digitize the most valuable books in the gentlest way and in the best quality. As a floor-standing device that can be operated comfortably from a seated position and has a wide range of control modules for operation by hand or foot control, it also guarantees smooth ergonomic operation. All this in combination with high productivity and the robustness and reliability you have come to expect from us. This means you can tackle even those projects where very special treasures need to be transferred from the analog to the digital world without breaking a sweat.`,categories:["A2","REPROGRAPHIC SYSTEMS","ARCHIVE SCANNERS","BOOK SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A2"}]},{name:"Folio",slug:"folio",image:"/images/book2net/A31.jpg",type:"A3 Book Scanner",overview:`Compact and efficient book scanning solution

Anyone who has ever scanned very old books knows how fragile these precious items are. They have often been around for centuries, and the ravages of time have made the pages porous and the spines brittle. For such cases, we have various solutions within our book2net product range that meet these special requirements and allow gentle yet productive scanning with a reduced opening angle of between 110° and 90°: from our desktop devices such as the Falcon and the Lizard to our double camera head system Cobra and our absolute high-end system, the book2net Dragon.

But even our devices can reach their limits with books in a particularly critical state of preservation. There are cases where a book can only be opened at a minimum angle of 45°. This is where the Wolfenbütteler Buchspiegel comes into play. As a joint development by Kaiser Fototechnik, Image Engineering and the Herzog-August-Bibliothek Wolfenbüttel, it was specially designed for digitizing such sensitive works. Moreover, the system is flexible and allows users to choose their own camera and lighting unit.

We are delighted to be able to offer this system to our customers as part of our portfolio. Equipped with our own book2net software and the HD camera systems (M70 or M150), the Wolfenbüttel Buchspiegel offers preservation care with the highest scanning quality.

But how exactly does the Wolfenbütteler Buchspiegel operate?

The books are placed in a V-shaped wedge of support panels with an opening angle of 45°. This angle in itself is not ideal, as the closer the area to be scanned is to the book fold, the more distortion occurs when scanning from above. To avoid such unsightly results, a mirror is used. To be more precise: The V-shaped glass plate, which is gently pressed onto the open double page, consists of a glass plate on one side, which presses one half of the double page, namely the half that is currently being scanned, smoothly. On the other side of the plate is a mirror. The page to be scanned is therefore mirrored and the mirror image is captured by the camera.

The ingenious design ensures that an image is created that looks as if the book page had been captured vertically − only mirror-inverted. The software mirrors the image again so that an exact copy of the original is ultimately saved.

The Wolfenbütteler Buchspiegel is suitable for books up to 20 cm thick. Formats with a maximum page size of 45 x 45 cm can be captured, i.e. easily pages in A3 format. The scanner is designed for particularly gentle handling of precious old books such as illuminated manuscripts in several respects. These include the book spine support with foam filling and fabric cover and the padded book page supports. You can also purchase a foot release for the camera and a lighting system with 272 LEDs. Thanks to the lighting unit's thermal management, brightness and color temperature remain unchanged regardless of whether the temperature of the device or the room changes.

So, if you want to digitize valuable library collections with extremely sensitive spines and folds, the Wolfenbütteler Buchspiegel is a sophisticated system that digitally preserves every page for future generations in a gentle process.`,categories:["A3","PRESERVATION SCANNERS","ARCHIVE SCANNERS","BOOK SCANNERS"],specs:[{label:"Scan Size",value:"A3"}]},{name:"FUJIFILM GFX100S",slug:"gfx100s",image:"/images/book2net/camera1.jpg",type:"Medium-format mirrorless camera",overview:`The compact medium-format camera

You can't do without sharpness. If you want to digitize a document, a drawing or a map, regardless of its size, you can expect an exact reproduction. Right down to the last corner. But not every technology makes this possible. You can rely on our M150. The 152-megapixel sensor alone speaks for itself, but that's not all that makes this repro camera so special.

The M150 can be integrated into all our scanning systems. So, you can enjoy both advantages: the flexibility of a handy camera and the convenience of our state-of-the-art scanners.

The global shutter does not allow any blurring, as all pixels of the original to be digitized are exposed simultaneously. Everything is captured within an extremely short exposure time. Thanks to this technology, perfectly uniform sharpness is achieved.

You can choose between a color, grayscale and multispectral sensor. The multispectral sensor offers possibilities that will make the heart of anyone interested in history beat even faster. By using infrared and UV light, different "layers" of a document can be made visible.

The M150 camera is very robust thanks to the quality of the material, the high-quality workmanship and the absence of moving parts. The result is digital copies that meet the highest standards. And in no time at all, because efficiency is another aspect that is fully met by this camera.
