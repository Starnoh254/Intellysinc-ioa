            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In the garden centre sector, where the variety of products, suppliers, and seasonal cycles makes logistics extremely complex, Intellisync's intelligent agents are revolutionizing document and operational management. Thanks to our Agentic AI technology, Intellisync allows leading companies in the sector to transform their daily operations, making them smoother, traceable, and more sustainable.</p>
            
            <h2>The Challenge: Complex Warehouses and Fragmented Supplies</h2>
            <p>Nurseries manage a highly varied supply chain: seeds, pots, fertilizers, plants in different growth stages, with suppliers distributed nationally and internationally. Each shipment generates different documents (delivery notes, DDTs, invoices, phytosanitary passports), often received in different formats and filed manually.</p>
            
            <p>This traditional approach leads to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Long times to retrieve related documents</li>
              <li>Risks of errors in stock management</li>
              <li>Lack of visibility on the relationship between orders, deliveries, and invoicing</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>The Intellisync Solution: Intelligent Automation and Relational Document Management</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)</h3>
            <p>Intellisync digitizes and automatically interprets paper or PDF documents, even handwritten ones, extracting critical data such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Item codes/plant descriptions</li>
              <li>Quantities and prices</li>
              <li>Delivery destinations</li>
              <li>Supplier data</li>
              <li>Phytosanitary passport information</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With just one click, you can teach Intellisync where to read the data of interest, eliminating hours of manual entry. The main solution consists in the precise alignment between the data contained in paper documents, sometimes even handwritten, and the customer's ERP for an inventory of just under 100,000 managed plants.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Knowledge Graph and Related Documents</h3>
            <p>Thanks to Graph Database technology, Intellisync creates relationships between documents such as purchase orders, DDTs, invoices, and claims, building a navigable document graph:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>From order to delivery to invoice: all documents are automatically linked</li>
              <li>It is possible to view the supply history for a single item or supplier</li>
              <li>Anomalies (e.g., incomplete deliveries) are automatically detected and notified to the user in real-time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Workflow Automation and Validation</h3>
            <p>Through automated AI agents:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Delivery notes are checked against orders</li>
              <li>Invoices are accepted only if consistent with the quantities actually received</li>
              <li>Discrepancies trigger automatic alerts</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This automation reduces errors, waste, and delays, leading to an actual time saving of 90%.</p>
            
            <h2>A Concrete Case: Centralized Garden Centre Management</h2>
            <p>The client is a major garden centre / nursery in Central Italy that implemented Intellisync to coordinate 4 regional logistics hubs:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Over 200 suppliers</li>
              <li>15,000 active references</li>
              <li>Thousands of transport documents each month</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>With Intellisync, they achieved:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>90% reduction in delivery verification times</li>
              <li>Real and measured ROI exceeding 1500% in less than 3 months</li>
              <li>Complete elimination of errors in transport documents and invoices</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Intellisync provides detailed statistics and real-time insights based on transport documents scanned in the various warehouses distributed across the territory, allowing management to intervene thanks to various alerts on the supply chain.</p>
            
            <h2>Integration with ERP and Archiving Systems</h2>
            <p>Intellisync connects in real-time with ERPs and platforms such as SAP, SharePoint, or Xerox DocuShare, keeping data always synchronized and accessible.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Benefits for Garden Centres</h2>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Intellisync, the Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) platform powered by Artificial Intelligence, continues to revolutionize enterprise document management with the release of version 14.0. The new features enhance automation, efficiency, and organization of digital documents, offering advanced tools to create document relationships, analyze complex tables more reliably than ever, and intuitively modify PDF files.</p>
            
            <p>Discover how Intellisync 14.0 can optimize your document processes, reducing management time and increasing business productivity.</p>
            
            <h2>New UI/UX for Document Relationship Management</h2>
            <p>One of the key innovations in Intellisync 14.0 is the revamped graphical interface for document relationships, allowing users to intelligently link different types of documents through a visual and interactive node system.</p>
            
            <p>With Intellisync, document relationships are not restricted to predefined system entities. Instead, they are dynamically generated by the user, who freely defines the connection properties. Thanks to the innovative use of Knowledge Graphs, this market-unique flexibility enables the creation of a fully customized information network, perfectly adapting to each company's needs.</p>
            
            <h3>Why are Document Relationships Essential?</h3>
            <p>In business environments, documents rarely exist in isolation. Invoices, purchase orders, contracts, emails, and reports are interconnected and often need to be referenced together. With Intellisync 14.0, creating intelligent links between documents is quick and easy, eliminating manual searches and improving workflow efficiency.</p>
            
            <h3>How do Document Connections Work in Intellisync 14.0?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Intuitive visual interface:</strong> Link documents with just a few clicks using a clear and interactive node system</li>
              <li><strong>Customizable connection rules:</strong> Document relationships are based on user-defined properties. Connections support five criteria:
                <ul>
                  <li>Equal: perfect match between two values</li>
                  <li>Contains / Is contained in: useful for finding keywords or identifying subsets of information</li>
                  <li>Similar to / Very similar to: allows linking documents with similar properties (e.g., close dates or approximately matching numbers)</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li><strong>AI-powered automation:</strong> Intellisync automatically suggests the most relevant connections between documents, reducing setup time and improving accuracy</li>
              <li><strong>Unlimited scalability:</strong> Create true relationship chains, without limits, between any number of documents and properties</li>

            <p>Together, these tools create a seamless workflow that transforms the way businesses handle documents.</p>
            
            <p>For those familiar with Intellisync's prior versions, you know its ability to extract data from virtually any document is second to none. The introduction of Intellisync Hub enhances this prowess by addressing a critical bottleneck: identifying what type of document you're dealing with in the first place.</p>
            
            <p>The impact is particularly striking in industries where efficiency and accuracy are mission-critical, such as manufacturing, logistics and transport, medical, finance and accounting and energy sectors. Let's explore how Intellisync Hub and Intellisync's data extraction engine are creating value in these fields.</p>
            
            <h2>Streamlining Logistics and Transport Operations</h2>
            <p>The logistics and transport industry thrives on precision. From bills of lading to delivery confirmations, every document needs to be processed efficiently to keep goods moving. Delays in document handling can result in delivery failures or compliance issues.</p>
            
            <p>Intellisync Hub makes this seamless by first classifying large, mixed batches of documents. A scanned bundle containing invoices, customs declarations, and packing lists is split into individual files, ready for further processing. Intellisync then extracts critical data such as tracking numbers, destinations, and declared values.</p>
            
            <p>For a freight forwarding company managing thousands of shipments daily, Intellisync ensures no document is misplaced and that all relevant data is available for smooth customs clearance and on-time delivery.</p>
            
            <h2>Improving Accuracy in Medical Document Handling</h2>
            <p>In the medical sector, document management plays a crucial role in patient care and regulatory compliance. From insurance claims to patient records, the ability to process sensitive documents quickly and accurately can directly impact lives.</p>
            
            <p>With Intellisync Hub, hospitals and clinics can handle diverse inputs, such as scanned patient forms or bulk-uploaded insurance claims. Intellisync Hub automatically identifies document types, while Intellisync extracts specific data like patient details, diagnosis codes, or payment amounts. This ensures that medical staff spend less time on administrative tasks and more time on patient care.</p>
            
            <p>Consider a hospital handling thousands of claims monthly: Intellisync eliminates the risk of misclassification or data entry errors, ensuring timely reimbursements and compliance with healthcare regulations.</p>
            
            <h2>Turning Employee Expense Management into a Breeze</h2>
            <p>Let's revisit the common task of processing employee reimbursements, which is often a source of frustration for HR and finance teams alike. Employees typically submit receipts in bulk—a mix of restaurant bills, transportation tickets, and hotel invoices—all jumbled together.</p>
            
            <p>This is where Intellisync Hub shines. It steps in first, identifying each document as a distinct item: a meal receipt, a cab fare, or a hotel stay.</p>
            
            <p>Once classified, Intellisync takes over, extracting crucial details such as the total amount, date, and vendor name. With this information in hand, Intellisync can even flag inconsistencies, like a missing signature on a hotel invoice or an unusually high meal expense, for manual review.</p>
            
            <p>The result? A streamlined, accurate process that saves hours of manual effort and reducing errors.</p>
            
            <h2>Supercharging Legal Document Workflows</h2>
            <p>Legal teams are accustomed to dealing with stacks of mixed documents: contracts, amendments, affidavits, and correspondence often arrive in a single scan or upload. The challenge isn't just sorting these files but also extracting actionable data from them, such as dates, client names, and contractual terms.</p>
            
            <p>Intellisync Hub takes care of the first step, automatically identifying and separating each document type. Once that's done, Intellisync's extraction engine goes to work, pulling out the exact data points required. Its ability to handle complex layouts, handwritten text, and even multi-page tables ensures that no detail is overlooked.</p>
            
            <p>For example, a scanned contract and its amendments might be grouped and classified by Intellisync Hub. Then, Intellisync extracts critical clauses, payment terms, and signatures, presenting them in an easily accessible format.</p>
            
            <p>The synergy between classification and extraction ensures that legal professionals can focus on analysis and strategy instead of administration.</p>
            
            <h2>The Perfect Partnership: Intellisync Hub and Intellisync Data Extraction</h2>
            <p>Intellisync Hub is the ultimate front-end for document automation.

            <p>Some of the highlights of this powerful combination include:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Adaptability to any document type:</strong> Intellisync's AI can be trained on any document layout with just one example, ensuring accurate extraction no matter how varied your documents may be</li>
