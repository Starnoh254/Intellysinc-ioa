    overview: `Designed for the highest demands\n\nWhether heavy newspaper volumes or large-format lightweights such as posters, plans and paintings – you need a scanning system for all of these with a focus on ergonomics. Just like the outstanding quality of the digitized documents and the high level of efficiency, this is a decisive factor why you should opt for our high-performance book2net Hornet scanner. It is the “big brother” of our book2net Mosquito scanner and scans documents in formats up to A0.\n\nA central element is the motorized book cradle with two lifting columns. Each of them can be loaded with up to 180 kilos. This means that there are no limits to the selection of documents and books that can be scanned. The book2net Hornet is also available with a fixed support table as an option, but let’s start with the book cradle here.\n\nThe A0 surface is divided into two halves. If you want to digitize a newspaper volume, for example, you can use the lifting columns so that the surface of the double pages is always at the same height. If you are scanning pages 5 and 6 of a thick volume, the right-hand column must move downwards, whereas once you have reached the last pages, the left-hand column moves downwards.\n\nYou can also save corresponding processes – for example, lowering a lifting column after a set number of pages – in the software. If you switch the scanner off and on again sometime later, all settings for this scan project are saved and you can continue working immediately without any delay.\n\nThe height of the book cradle can be adjusted by up to 25 centimeters, the same amount as the spine release. This makes the book2net Hornet ideal for gentle scanning of particularly thick books with sensitive spines.\n\nIn addition to the book cradle, this device is also equipped with a motorized glass plate. With gentle pressure, it ensures that there is no unevenness in the original. The motorized downward movement of the non-reflective glass plate should please every user, especially with large formats. As with all our systems, ergonomics is a top priority here too.\n\nThe technical features of the book2net Hornet are perfectly coordinated in every respect. Take the dual camera technology, for example, where you can choose between the M70 and M150 variants. The Schneider-Kreuznach precision lenses and CMOS area sensors guarantee that all areas of the original are captured simultaneously, which saves a considerable amount of time without compromising on quality. Further quality guarantees: the dual lighting unit, which can be controlled individually or synchronously, and the Fresnel lenses for uniform illumination.\n\nWhether in Dubai, Mauritius or Brandenburg – the book2net Hornet has been used near and far and has done its job reliably. It is an absolute asset for every archive and library because it covers even the largest formats, delivers perfect quality and enables everyone who uses this system to work quickly and conveniently.`,

    overview: `The new era of art digitization\n\nDiving into the structures\n\nWe are convinced that this scanner complements our book2net range perfectly. We have therefore decided to include the Synchron Table LV2 from CRUSE Technologies GmbH in our portfolio in addition to our high-quality scanning systems. Its technology is used less for digitizing historical written documents, sketches, posters or maps and more for materials such as wood or stone, as well as carpets and wallpaper, for example. And in formats from DIN A1 to DIN A0+.\n\nWhat is it all about? The Synchron Table LV2 knows how to use its camera and lighting units so skillfully and flexibly that it captures and brings out every accentuation of the material down to the smallest detail. Among other things, the angle between the LED light and the original plays a decisive role. This scanner can also be set to different modes, depending on what you want to take a closer look at and present to all those who will be viewing the digital copy. For example, the heights and depths in the surface structure can be examined in detail.\n\nThe Synchron Table LV2 is used in art reproduction, for decorative surfaces and when it comes to investigating the interaction of light and material properties (PBR-based 3D rendering). Excellent resolution with 600 ppi, perfect illumination, not least thanks to the 150 sensors that monitor the LED temperature, and a color fidelity that leaves nothing to be desired − all this is given with the Synchron Table LV2.\n\nThe fact that the scanning table, which is available in different sizes, can withstand originals weighing up to 400 kilos, speaks for the robustness of this scanner on the one hand and underlines the variety of possible applications on the other. The originals, for example works of art, wood or stone, can be up to ten centimeters thick.\n\nThe Synchron Table LV2 leaves nothing to be desired and therefore fits perfectly into the range of our book2net scanning systems. Because excellent results are our top priority.`,

    type: 'Professional A1 V-scanner',
    overview: `Preservation-grade digitization meets industrial productivity\n\nThe book2net Lizard can easily cope with large formats. This scanning system combines the highest quality of imaging with enormous productivity. What’s more, the Lizard is designed to prevent damage to the large and often sensitive and valuable books that it transforms into the digital world.\n\nEspecially for old, bulky books with a binding and page curvature that require a reduced opening angle, the user has a variable V-shaped book support at their disposal, the plates of which can be adjusted between 80 and 120 degrees if required. To ensure that nothing goes wrong in the critical area of the book fold, the scanner also provides a spine exemption with a width of up to ten centimeters, optionally up to 20 centimeters, and a depth of up to eight centimeters. There is also a height-adjustable spine support to ensure that the book does not slip downwards.\n\nTo match the V-book cradle, the Lizard is equipped with a V-shaped 110° glass plate that can be controlled manually to gently smooth the book pages and thus achieve the best scanning results. It goes without saying that the plate is made of special non-reflective glass, so there are no negative effects on the scans.\n\nThis also applies to the uniform illumination of the book pages and the equally high scanning quality at every point on the surface, ensured by the CMOS area sensor technology, the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens and the double illumination unit consisting of cold light LEDs. You can choose between the M70 and the M150, both from MICROBOX, as the camera for the Lizard. Particularly with large-format originals, such as old atlases, the distance between the book fold and the lens is significantly greater than from the page edges to the lens. However, the unique double camera technology guarantees that the entire surface of the original is precisely captured and reproduced in perfect sharpness. The lighting is also of particular importance in this context, as the software is already set at the factory so that the most intense light shines in the direction of the book fold in order to precisely compensate for the long distance.\n\nBrilliant color accuracy, perfect linearity, no distortions – the book2net Lizard achieves the highest quality. At the same time, the books to be digitized are optimally protected without compromising productivity. The scanning time of just 0.3 seconds and the processing time, i.e. from scanning to saving, of 3.5 seconds are more than impressive.\n\nThese are ideal conditions for tackling large and important projects. For example, when working with the National Library of Poland, where 652,000 very different objects are being digitized with the Lizard, including 305 particularly valuable atlases, the oldest of which dates back to 1522. A high level of responsibility towards all these works is required here, as well as outstanding efficiency to cope with this enormous volume. A project made for the book2net Lizard.`,

    type: 'A1 Hybrid Scanner',
    overview: `Two devices – one software\n\nA must in every digitization center\n\nIt’s not easy to work carefully and gently while making rapid progress. Or is it? The hybrid scanning solution from book2net makes exactly that possible. In archives and libraries, you have to deal with very diverse collections: centuries-old, fragile and porous documents and books on the one hand, and masses of documents in stacks and boxes that seem almost impossible to process on the other. Digitizing all this is a challenge that requires a system you can rely on. Or even better: two systems.\n\nThe hybrid scanning solution from book2net combines the advantages of two “scanning worlds”: contactless, gentle digitization by our overhead scanners in formats up to A1 with the efficiency of the SCAMIG document scanner specially designed for us, which can handle documents up to A3 in size.\n\nThe overhead scanner takes care of the gentle digitization of books, fragile documents or objects such as seals. It is easy to operate and guarantees excellent image quality. As a congenial partner, the SCAMIG is entrusted with robust individual pages or entire stacks of documents, which are fed and digitized much faster than could be achieved with an overhead scanner. But speed is not everything, because the SCAMIG also handles the sheets with care, as the patented belt transport is particularly gentle. The speed of the document feeder can also be reduced. And you can use the rear output tray for thicker paper or cardboard, for example, so that the document is not turned over in the device.\n\nBut how exactly does the application of the systems work in practice in the digitization process? Both devices are connected to the same computer. We are happy to provide a specially designed PC for this purpose. The advantage: all devices come from a single source and there is only one contact person. If you prefer to use your own computer, that is also possible. The software is then installed there.\n\nThe scans from the SCAMIG document scanner are also saved via the software of the overhead scanner and are available there for further processing and organization. Regardless of which scanner is currently in use, the documents are saved in the correct order. Thanks to the multi-page option, it is possible to save several documents in one file. The job function is also particularly convenient, as it can be used to save settings made for a project so that you can easily continue the next time you open it.`,

    overview: `The versatile V-shape scanning studio\n\nThe Dragon starts, where other scanning systems reach their limits\n\nEven the sight of this scanning system, equipped with sophisticated technology, sends out a signal: This is the ultimate. When it comes to digitizing two-dimensional originals, the book2net Dragon is gold standard. It impresses with its high level of flexibility. Individual settings can be made precisely for each original, and standardized scan sequences can be defined to achieve high productivity without effort.\n\nThe Dragon can scan books in formats from A1 to A4 and is also suitable for particularly heavy copies: The book cradle can withstand 180 kilos and should therefore be able to cope with anything the user requires.\n\nThe Dragon is the ideal system for old, valuable books that need to be handled with the utmost care, but whose nuances, however subtle, need to be digitally preserved for future generations. Whether special inks and colors, gold grounds and gildings – every spot, every aspect of the pages is digitized true to the original. So, it’s no wonder that the book2net Dragon was chosen for a particularly sensitive project at the National Library of Scotland, in which rare, illuminated manuscripts from the Middle Ages are being scanned.\n\nTo make working with the book2net Dragon easy, the system provides perfect technology and a high level of operating convenience: the cameras can be moved individually on slide rails and the setting angles can be changed as required. The LED lighting concept is also sophisticated: The dual lighting unit can be controlled individually or synchronously. Fresnel lenses ensure uniform illumination, and the light emission angle can be infinitely adjusted.\n\nThen there is the book cradle, which is set to a book-friendly 110° as standard, but whose opening angle can be changed if required. It also has a book spine exemption – up to ten centimeters wide (optionally up to 20 cm) and up to eight centimeters deep. This ensures that even thick book spines can be digitized gently, without causing annoying bulges in the folding area. In addition, a continuously height-adjustable book spine support with a gentle surface prevents the book from “slipping through”. The book cradle can also be easily raised and lowered using a motorized profile lifting column to ensure the same distance between the lens and the book at all times, regardless of how thick the latter is. A double LED positioning aid helps to position the book perfectly, while generous storage areas on both sides of the book cradle facilitate the work process.\n\nOn request, a non-reflective V-shape glass plate can be installed in the Dragon to smooth wavy book pages with gentle pressure. The adjustable pressure sensitivity, full electronic pressure control and integrated movement monitoring ensure the safety of both the valuable originals and the user.\n\nKeyword lens: Schneider-Kreuznach precision lenses are fitted as standard, which produce distortion-free results with brilliant color accuracy and perfect linearity. However, for special requirements special lenses can be used as well. When it comes to cameras, there is a choice between the M70 and the M150, both of which are book2net quality products. The scanning time of 0.3 seconds shows that the Dragon also stands for enormous efficiency.\n\nFrom the cameras and lenses to the lighting, the book cradle and the software, the book2net Dragon is a system that leaves nothing to be desired. You can benefit from the considerable productivity and at the same time be prepared for every individual case thanks to the flexibly adjustable technology. All this combined with a high level of user-friendliness. The Dragon is an all-round carefree package for anyone who wants to digitize historical treasures perfectly and gently.`,

    type: 'A1 Book Scanner',
    overview: `High-end V-scanner with semi-robotic\n\nThe best choice for your valuable collection\n\nActually, all old books, manuscripts and documents that are digitized in archives or libraries are valuable. Otherwise, they would not be kept, let alone scanned. But there are treasures that stand out among all these silent yet exciting witnesses to the past. The Gutenberg Bible, for example. Around 570 years old, it was the first book to be printed in movable type. There are only a few copies left, two of which are in the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. Our book2net Cobra A2 was used to digitize these impressive and extremely sensitive works. The device was specially designed to carefully transport precious rare books and manuscripts, which should literally only be handled with kid gloves, into the digital world.\n\nEverything about the book2net Cobra, which is available in A1 and A2 versions, is designed to ensure that these treasures of written and pictorial tradition are not damaged during scanning. The book cradle is equipped with an opening angle of 110°: The resulting V-shape makes it possible for even the most fragile books and manuscripts, which for conservation reasons may not be opened at an angle of 180°, to be digitized in the gentlest way. Damage to the binding and book spine is also prevented by the book spine exemption, which can be conveniently adapted to the respective original and can even accommodate books up to 20 cm thick.\n\nThe Cobra has two gentle pressure methods to ensure that the pages of the books do not close again during the scanning process but remain open. On the one hand, it can be operated with the permanently installed V-shaped non-reflective glass plate, whose pressure sensitivity and opening mode can be individually adjusted using various control modules.  This not only protects the books, but also saves the user unnecessary time during the scanning process.\n\nHowever, if even this gentle glass pressure is too hard on an original, the Cobra can easily be operated without it. The V-shaped “butterfly system” with four Plexiglas pressure fingers is available for this purpose. It can be adapted to any book size and is synchronized with the scanning process so that it opens and closes automatically. If you want to work with the permanently installed glass plate again, you can simply remove it at any time. In the case of precious items for which even the “butterfly system” is not justifiable from a conservation point of view, the pages can be hold down purely manually using special tools developed by us.\n\nWhile the V-shaped book cradle and glass plate ensure optimum book support, the camera and lighting technology of the book2net Cobra guarantee that the book pages can be captured evenly and without distortion right down to the depths of the book fold in the best quality.\n\nWith the book2net Cobra, two camera systems with high-resolution CMOS area sensors are used in parallel. This achieves unrivalled quality in the resolution rate. The customer can choose between using our M70 or M150 camera systems as required.\n\nAnother key element for image quality is the glare-free lighting unit, which is gentle on both the operator and the original. If old books and manuscripts are exposed to high light intensity, biochemical processes can be triggered – depending on the duration and light intensity – that lead to structural changes in the paper, ink and color, causing irreparable damage. It is therefore essential to keep both the light intensity and the exposure time as low as possible during the scanning process.\n\nThe book2net Cobra works with an extremely reduced exposure time of 0.5 seconds at a scanning speed of just 0.3 seconds. The lighting module specially developed for the book2net Cobra also makes it possible to adapt the illumination to conservation requirements and reduce it to a light intensity of <= 2500 lux.\n\nIn addition, valuable old books such as illuminated manuscripts can pose special challenges for digitization: waved surfaces, special inks and colors, especially gold grounds and gildings often require more than standard lighting to achieve a perfect shadow- and reflection-free result. For this purpose, the book2net Cobra has additional lighting that can be integrated, mounted or controlled externally as required. The lighting units can be operated individually and synchronously, and thanks to the Fresnel lenses, the illumination is absolutely uniform.\n\nAll components of the book2net Cobra are designed to digitize the most valuable books in the gentlest way and in the best quality. As a floor-standing device that can be operated comfortably from a seated position and has a wide range of control modules for operation by hand or foot control, it also guarantees smooth ergonomic operation. All this in combination with high productivity and the robustness and reliability you have come to expect from us. This means you can tackle even those projects where very special treasures need to be transferred from the analog to the digital world without breaking a sweat.`,

    type: 'A1 Archive Scanner',
    overview: `Ergonomics, ease of use & quality\n\nOutstanding features to suit your requirements\n\nAnyone working in an archive has to deal with exciting and revealing treasures from the past, with bound or stapled documents, with individual paper pages, with large and small formats, with smooth or corrugated surfaces. If you want to digitize all of this to make it available to people now and in the future, you need a scanning system that you can rely on and that is just as versatile as the originals that need to be digitized. The solution: the book2net Archive Pro.\n\nThis scanner is available in A1 and A2 versions. Of course, the Archive Pro is also ideal for transferring small formats to the digital world. To do this, the camera simply moves up close and within a few seconds a true-to-original image with clear resolution is created, everything is sharp, and the colors remain unaltered. This applies to any format. Keyword camera: You can choose whether the Archive Pro should be equipped with our M70 or M150 camera version.\n\nThe Archive Pro has three large LED lights − one at the back, one on the left and one on the right. Let’s assume we place a thick book with a deep fold on the book cradle. If we want to avoid casting shadows, the book is only illuminated from above with the rear light. If, on the other hand, the right or left page is to be “staged” with raking light, it is advisable to illuminate only the right or left side. However, if you want to illuminate the entire original evenly, all three lights are needed.\n\nWhile the camera slider and the lights are the quality guarantors in the upper area of the Archive Pro, the glass plate and the book cradle in the lower area ensure that excellent results are achieved. As with the other book2net production scanners, the book cradle of the Archive Pro also compensates for the weight and thickness of the book and thus ensures that the surface of a double-page book is always on the same level during the scanning process. The Archive Pro is also equipped with special features: As an extra, both sides of the book cradle can be controlled separately. In addition, the book cradle can be moved against the glass plate from below to save time and effort.\n\nAnd finally, not to be neglected: the user comfort. The camera slider and book cradle have already been mentioned. The glass plate – non-reflective, of course – can be used in different ways depending on requirements, whether in a fixed position, self-opening or individually adjustable with the help of an electric motor. Another important feature is that you can see what the digital copy will look like on the screen. The user therefore always has full control.`,

    type: 'Versatile & scalable reprographic studio',
    overview: `The versatile solution to meet your requirements\n\nVersatile is perhaps the most appropriate word to describe our book2net reprographic studio. With this device, all formats from A6 to A0 can be digitized, regardless of whether a book, a loose page, a photo, a poster or an object such as a coin is placed on the support table. The reprographic system is therefore particularly interesting for archives and museums, which often store a veritable smorgasbord of documents and objects.\n\nWhat immediately catches the eye is the camera slider, which can extend the distance between the support table and the lens to up to 1.80 meters. This means that even particularly large formats can be scanned. If you want to digitize a small piece of paper or even a stamp after a poster, for example, you simply let the camera slide downwards, close to the object. Incidentally, there are three ways to do this: the cheapest is a crank, which is used to manually adjust the height of the camera, more convenient is the adjustment at the touch of a button, and the “gold standard” is the software, which recognizes what is on the support table and adjusts the camera correctly without the user having to do anything. Whichever option you choose, the quality of the result is always the same, always excellent.\n\nWhy is the perfect distance between the camera and the original so important? With large formats, it is obvious that the distance must be correspondingly large to fully capture a poster, for example. However, if it is something small, such as a stamp, the resolution would suffer greatly if the distance to the camera were unnecessarily large. Thanks to the camera slider, the reprographic studio does not “give away” any quality but achieves the best possible result.\n\nKeyword quality: for it to be perfect, the lighting needs to be just right. This is also provided by the system. The two LED daylight lights ensure soft and even illumination. The diffuser panels on the LED lights contribute to this and prevent shadows being cast, which could occur with three-dimensional objects such as a coin.\n\nThe high-performance area sensor and the Schneider-Kreuznach precision lens are further pillars of the reprographic system, which ensure that the digital image looks exactly like the original, right down to the last corner. No distortions, no blurring, no color divergences.\n\nSpeaking of versatility: we offer this system with our own M70 or M150 cameras, but third-party cameras such as the Sony Alpha or the Fuji GFX can also be integrated without any problems. The size of the support table is also variable. You can choose between the maximum formats A1, A2 and A3. A0 is also possible on request.\n\nThe versatility goes even further, because if you opt for a book2net repro system, you can buy a few extras or add them later. Depending on the project, a light table – in various formats, of course – and a support for slides or glass negatives can be practical aids. This also applies to the book holder and many other extras that are compatible with our reprographic studio.\n\nAnyone who opts for this scanning system therefore receives a tailor-made solution that can be individually expanded. This wealth of variants is coupled with quality criteria that characterize all our devices: effective work with a robust device, excellent results, simple operation. In other words, with the book2net reprographic studio you will have enormous added value and great pleasure.`,

    overview: `Robust design & reliable performance\n\nAnyone who wants to digitize heavy volumes of newspapers double-page by double-page will be pleased if modern technology makes it much faster and the scanner is easy and convenient to use. In the Irish Newspaper Archives, for example, the reliable services of the book2net Flash are greatly appreciated. Millions of newspaper pages of various titles from a period of over 200 years have already been digitally archived – also thanks to the Flash, which does not stand for tedious work, but for fast and smooth workflow.\n\nThe book2net Flash was created especially for large formats up to A1, which also have a considerable weight. The newspaper volumes mentioned above are a good example. High productivity and workplace ergonomics are key elements that we attach great importance to. Added to this is the outstanding quality of the digital copies and the gentle handling of the books and other originals, which are placed on the book cradle or – optionally – on the fixed support table.\n\nHow does the Flash ensure that the user can work as comfortably and quickly as possible? A key component of this scanning system is the double lifting column, which ensures that the height of the book is equalized. This means that no matter which page is open, the correct lifting column always goes down just far enough so that the surface of the double page to be scanned forms exactly one level. Height compensation of up to 25 centimeters is possible. This is also the size of the book spine exemption, which can accommodate the binding of particularly thick books. This all serves to ensure that the area sensor, which detects all areas simultaneously, hits a level. This is further enhanced by the motorized glass plate, which lies gently on the original, creating no reflections and damaging nothing.\n\nPrecise positioning on the book cradle is one factor that leads to the perfect result. Other factors are the technical elements located in the upper section of the device. For example, the aforementioned area sensor, which, with its simultaneous detection of all areas, not only ensures high quality, but also works much faster than if it were to scan slowly – like a line sensor, for example – over the original. A scanning time of 0.3 seconds and a total processing time of 2.2 seconds speak for themselves. The Schneider-Kreuznach lens and the adjustable double illumination unit are further guarantees for excellent results.\n\nAll these weighty arguments in favor of investing in the book2net Flash are underpinned by further strengths: The camera used is also a book2net product, and you can choose between the M70 and the M150. The software makes working even more convenient, for example, scan sequences can be programmed. What’s more, the Flash is quiet and energy-saving and – as you would expect from our products – extremely robust and durable.\n\nThe book2net Flash is the perfect choice for anyone who wants high productivity, simple operation, a comfortable workstation and excellent results when dealing with huge volumes of material to be digitized. Large formats, small effort – a relaxed way to reach your goal.`,
