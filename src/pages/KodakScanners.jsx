    overview: 'Faster, easier scanning leaves more time for business. The Kodak S2050 Scanners enhance your productivity by handling more of the work traditionally done by people, computers and mobile devices. Embedded Image Processing in the scanner delivers crisp, high-quality images without depending on your computer. Active Feed technology aligns the leading edges of pages to avoid misfeeds and multifeeds, and Controlled Output Stacking places paper neatly in the output tray, so your team spends less time dealing with documents and more time on work that matters. Document and information handling you can trust. Ensure reliable data quality at the point of capture through a combined approach of hardware and software technologies. Intelligent Exception Processing1 handles immediate validation of forms so any missing information can be identified and fixed at the point of transaction. Intelligent Document Protection and multifeed sensor technology make scanning virtually jam-free and document-damage-free. Industry standard enterprise security protocols for scanning over networks protect document images and data in transit. Easy to set up, easy to use. An intuitive color interface and predefined job setups simplify the lives of users and network administrators. Predefined job setups let users change scanner configuration at the push of a button or by scanning auto-generated QR codes. Connect to various applications such as Dropbox, Salesforce, OneDrive, SharePoint, SharePoint Online, Box, Google Drive, and more. Network models, including wireless connectivity, enable multiple users to easily share scanners in a distributed environment. Information capture that evolves with your business. The Kodak S2050 Scanners are designed to fit seamlessly into your business environment and adapt as your needs change.

    overview: 'Superb image quality and data accuracy â automatically. Minimize data entry costs and time spent while transforming important paper-based information into actionable data and insight. Perfect Page technology turns even poor-quality originals into crisp images â automatically assessing and improving each image while scanning at rated speeds. Image enhancements include streak removal, background smoothing, image edge fill, and more. Achieve superb accuracy thatâs a must for barcode reading and critical business processes. Totally safeguard your paper and data. Potential throughput issues are caught before they become jams or misfeeds, thanks to Advanced Intelligent Document Protection (IDP) and multi-feed detectors. Documents transported smoothly and safely via a straightthrough paper path and adjustable feeder pressure. Smoothly handle varying weights and sizes in single batches, and gain mixed-batch handling accuracy with a bigger 300-sheet feeder and controlled exit stacking. Scan oversize and fragile documents safely, as well as books, photos, etc. on the integrated flatbed.',
